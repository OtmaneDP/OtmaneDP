I am a backend developer with a strong focus on building secure, scalable, and maintainable web applications. My expertise lies in the Laravel ecosystem, where I design clean architectures and develop robust RESTful APIs. I also work with Livewire and Alpine.js to create dynamic user experiences with minimal JavaScript, and utilize Tailwind CSS for efficient, responsive UI development. For complex frontend requirements, I integrate React to deliver seamless interactivity. I am committed to writing high-quality code, following best practices, and continuously improving through collaboration and ongoing learning. Open to contributing to open-source and working on impactful projects.
